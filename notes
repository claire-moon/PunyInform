[PunchSub;
	"With all of her might, Eleanor took a mighty swing through the air. As powerful a punch it was, O reader, it is with
	much sadness and a heavy heart that I must tell you that not only did the punch not connect with anything, in fact,
	there was nothing there to punch. I'm not really sure why she did that, but I hope it did something for her.";
